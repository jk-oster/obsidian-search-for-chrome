For all of you who are missing the Evernote browser search extension in Obsidian - here is your solution. This extension lets you search your Obsidian Vault simultaneously as you type your search in your favourite search engine.

- URL MATCHING: Search your vault for matches of your current url
- Scroll and open your matched Obsidian notes in the sidebar
- Exclude files and folders you don't want to show show up in the sidebar search
- Customize how much context you want to see


### Privacy
This extension just communicates between your local Obsidian REST Api and the browser. The only data that is stored permanently in the browser are the settings you find below. Feel free to check out the code base on GitHub

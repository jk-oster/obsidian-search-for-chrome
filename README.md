# Obsidian Web Search
## üîç Have a Evernote like search experience
For all of you who are missing the Evernote browser search extension in Obsidian - here is your solution. This extension lets you search your Obsidian Vault simultaneously as you type your search in your favourite search engine.

## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ LIVE SEARCH: Search your vault for notes matching your current search in e.q. the google search bar
- ‚úÖ URL MATCHING: Search your vault for matches of your current url while browsing
- ‚úÖ Scroll and open your matched Obsidian notes in the sidebar
- ‚úÖ Exclude files and folders you don't want to show show up in the sidebar search
- ‚úÖ Customize how much context you want to see

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy
This extension just communicates between your local Obsidian REST Api and the browser. The only data that is stored permanently in the browser are the settings including the Obsidian REST API-Key.

### üåê Browser compatibility
This extension has been tested with Chrome on Windows to be working. By using the webextension-polyfill library of mozilla.org it should also be compatible with Firefox though.

## üöß Test the extension
